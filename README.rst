Description
===========

The files of the interactive figure (*64 images*) of **Figure 2**, the interactive animation (*64 videos*) of **Figure 3**, the interactive figure (*192 images*) of **Figure 6**, and the compressed (tar.gz) file of the *6 machine-readable table files* (a portion shown for guidance regarding its form and content in **Table 3**) are archived on Zenodo. 

* `Figure 2 <https://galacticwinds.github.io/Catastrophic_Cooling_Superwinds_II_Data/figure2/>`_. From top to bottom: the interactive figure of the temperature and density profiles of the superwinds on a logarithmic scale. The different regions separated by dotted lines: (a) freely expanding wind, (b) shocked-wind, (c) shell, and (d) ambient medium. The adiabatic temperature and density profile for each model are shown by dashed lines.

* `Figure 3 <https://galacticwinds.github.io/Catastrophic_Cooling_Superwinds_II_Data/figure3/>`_. From top to bottom: the interactive animation of the temperature and density profiles of the superwinds on a logarithmic scale. The different regions separated by dotted lines: (a) freely expanding wind, (b) shocked-wind, (c) shell, and (d) ambient medium. The adiabatic temperature and density profile for each model are shown by dashed lines.

* `Figure 6 <https://galacticwinds.github.io/Catastrophic_Cooling_Superwinds_II_Data/figure6/>`_. Top Panels: The hydrogen temperature profiles (left panels) along with the adiabatic prediction (red dashed line) in the CPI case, and the line emissivities (right panels) of the superwind models on a logarithmic scale, from top to bottom, in the PI (pure photoionization) and CPI (photoionization + hydrodynamic collisional ionization) cases. Bottom Panels: The hydrogen density profiles (left panels) along with the adiabatic prediction (red dashed lines), and the ionic fractions (right panels) on a logarithmic scale for the PI and CPI cases. The start and end of the hot bubble (region b), the end of the shell (region c), and the Str√∂mgren radius are shown by dotted, dashed, dash-dotted, and solid lines (gray color), respectively.

* `Table 3 <https://galacticwinds.github.io/Catastrophic_Cooling_Superwinds_II_Data/table3/>`_. Integrated luminosities (unit in erg/s) from the different ionization models.
