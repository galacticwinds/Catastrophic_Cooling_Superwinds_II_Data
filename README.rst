Description
===========

The files of the interactive figure (64 images) of Figure 2, the interactive animation (64 videos) of Figure 3, the interactive figure (192 images) of Figure 6, and the compressed (tar.gz) file of the machine-readable table files (a portion shown for guidance regarding its form and content in Table 3) are archived on Zenodo. 

* **Figure 2**. From top to bottom: the interactive figure of the temperature and density profiles of the superwinds on a logarithmic scale. The different regions separated by dotted lines: (a) freely expanding wind, (b) shocked-wind, (c) shell, and (d) ambient medium. The adiabatic temperature and density profile for each model are shown by dashed lines.

* **Figure 3** From top to bottom: the interactive animation of the temperature and density profiles of the superwinds on a logarithmic scale. The different regions separated by dotted lines: (a) freely expanding wind, (b) shocked-wind, (c) shell, and (d) ambient medium. The adiabatic temperature and density profile for each model are shown by dashed lines.

* **Figure 6** Top Panels: The hydrogen temperature profiles (left panels) along with the adiabatic prediction (red dashed line) in the CP case, and the line emissivities (right panels) of the superwind models on a logarithmic scale, from top to bottom, in the P and CP cases. Bottom Panels: The hydrogen density profiles (left panels) along with the adiabatic prediction (red dashed lines), and the ionic fractions (right panels) on a logarithmic scale for the P and CP cases. The start and end of the hot bubble (region b), the end of the shell (region c), and the Str√∂mgren radius are shown by dotted, dashed, dash-dotted, and solid lines (gray color), respectively

* **Table 3** Integrated luminosities (unit in erg/s) from the different ionization models.
